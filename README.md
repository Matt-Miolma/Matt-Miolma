## Who I Am

I'm a builder at the intersection of **AI orchestration**, **clinical intelligence**, and **sovereign infrastructure** — with a background that doesn't fit a clean resume.

- 🪖 **82nd Airborne Division** — TS/SCI cleared, airborne-qualified
- 🏥 **Registered Nurse** — 8 years in neurosciences and oncology
- 🔬 **Self-taught AI researcher** — initiated through independent work at The Rowland Institute at Harvard
- 🏗️ **Founder** — building DKSA to solve one hard problem: deploying clinical AI that actually works inside healthcare systems

## What I'm Building

### 🏛️ DKSA — Digital Knowledge System Architects

An **AI Orchestrating Firm** focused on one market:

Clinical AI solutions grounded in real nursing experience — understanding the human factors, documentation patterns, and workflow realities that pure-tech firms miss.

> DKSA is technology-agnostic. The moat is relationships, domain expertise, and trust — not any specific stack.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository is a **61-week build sequence** progressing from foundational automation to enterprise-grade sovereign AI systems — built to demonstrate clinical-AI credibility to federal procurement decision-makers.

### 🏥 Clinical AI (Federal / VA Track)
- **Clinical NLP Pipelines** — structured extraction from unstructured nursing notes and EHR data
- **FHIR Interoperability** — HL7 FHIR R4 compliant data modeling
- **VA Trustworthy AI Framework Alignment** — responsible AI documentation and audit trails
- **Human Factors Analysis** — why healthcare AI fails in practice, and how to fix it
- **Responsible AI Frameworks** — bias detection, explainability, and clinical workflow integration

### 🧠 Sovereign Infrastructure
- **Private RAG Pipelines** — on-premise retrieval systems with zero data exfiltration
- **Neuro-Symbolic Architecture** — combining PostgreSQL, Qdrant (vector), and FalkorDB (knowledge graph)
- **Confidential Computing Demos** — Intel TDX / TEE integration for hardware-level privacy guarantees
- **Agentic Orchestration** — LangGraph + n8n workflows for proactive multi-step automation

## My Stack Philosophy

I build **open-source first, sovereignty always**:

```
Core Reasoning:     Llama 3 70B / Mixtral (local, quantized)
Agentic Assistant:  Llama 3 8B / Mistral 7B
Vector Store:       Qdrant
Knowledge Graph:    FalkorDB
Orchestration:      LangGraph + n8n (self-hosted)
Fine-Tuning:        Unsloth / Axolotl (QLoRA/LoRA)
Adapter Serving:    LoRAX (LoRA eXchange)
PII Scrubbing:      Microsoft Presidio (local)
Genomics:           NVIDIA Evo 2 / BioNeMo
Infra:              System76 Thelio + SkyPilot (hybrid cloud bursting)
Privacy Layer:      Intel TDX / Trusted Execution Environments
```

No vendor lock-in. No data leaving the perimeter unless scrubbed and anonymized first.

## Why This Combination Is Rare

My nursing background isn't a detour — it's the structural advantage. When a healthcare AI project fails, it's almost never a model accuracy problem. It's a **workflow problem**, a **documentation pattern problem**, a **human trust problem**. Eight years in a neuro/oncology unit gives me fluency in those failure modes that a computer science degree doesn't.

Military service adds another layer: federal procurement runs on mission clarity, accountability, and trust built over time. That's not a cultural adjustment for me — it's home turf.
