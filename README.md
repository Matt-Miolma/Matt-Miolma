# Hi, I'm Matt 👋

## Founder of Promptolution

I engineer sophisticated **Prompt Systems** for consumers, businesses, and governments. These aren't simple text snippets—they're architected solutions with systematic design methodology, modular architecture, and built-in conversation flows.

### What I Build

**Prompt Systems** are engineered frameworks that include:
- Modular, reusable components optimized for token efficiency
- Progressive user engagement (one question at a time)
- Built-in conversation initiation and flow control
- Systematic architecture designed for real-world deployment

**Robust contextual systems that include:**
- **Workflow automation** with n8n for dynamic context retrieval and system orchestration
- **Vector database integration** using open-source solutions for semantic search and context management
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers** for seamless tool integration and external service connections
- **Structured knowledge architectures** with RAG pipelines, embedding strategies, and context window optimization

### My Approach

I work with structured, systematic methodologies that transform complex requirements into efficient, production-ready prompt systems. My work focuses on:

- **Modularity**: Reusable components that deploy efficiently across contexts
- **Token Efficiency**: Optimized for performance without sacrificing capability
- **User Experience**: Progressive interaction patterns that feel natural
- **Machine Readability**: Structured formats with clear categorization and selection guides

### Areas of Focus

- Hallucination reduction techniques and implementation
- Professional disclaimer templates across domains
- LLM integration and optimization
- Reference material architecture for AI systems
- Self-development prompt templates

### Current Projects

Building comprehensive infrastructure for Promptolution, including conversion-optimized materials for business and government clients, machine-readable reference libraries, and expanding into consumer-facing prompt templates.
